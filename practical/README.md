# Practical

This folder contain examples of some more practical applications of rust, and some cool things you can build right now.

## Tauri - Build modern desktop apps

<https://tauri.app/>

## Yew - Writing your Single Page Application in Rust

## Actix - A powerful, pragmatic, and extremely fast web framework for Rust

(There are **many** API frameworks written in rust. See <https://www.arewewebyet.org/topics/frameworks/> for a short listing of some frameworks. This [blogpost](https://kerkour.com/rust-web-framework-2022) gives an opinion piece on the current "relevant" web frameworks in 2022. ``actix-web`` is probably the most well known, with ``warp`` and/or ``axum`` as other alternatives.)
