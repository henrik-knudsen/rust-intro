# Introduction to Rust (2022)

## Install

**rustup** is an installer for the systems programming language Rust. 

- Navigate to <https://rustup.rs/>
- Download rustup executable
- Run it to install rustc (compiler), cargo (package manager) and other dependencies.

In order to check that everything is set up correctly afterwards (current latest version is 1.64.0):

``rustc --version``

``cargo --version``

## IDE

- **Visual studio code**, with *rust analyzer* plugin.

OR

- **IntelliJ**, with IntelliJ rust plugin (may require license for the specific IDE you want to use, IntelliJ Idea or CLion)

Vscode with rust analyzer plugin provides a good developer experience and can be a nice starting point.
